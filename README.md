# Predicting Daily Rainfall in Australia

## Overview
Our goal for this project is to develop and deploy an ensemble approach to predict rainfall in Australia using different climate models included in [CMPI6](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip/wgcm-cmip6), which is an international collaboration of climate model outputs from different groups around the world. The dataset which is being used in this project can be found on [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Daily_rainfall_over_NSW_Australia/14096681).
